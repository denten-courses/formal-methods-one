## Course Description

This course on method in literary studies will introduce graduate students to the principles of
formal (as opposed to speculative) analysis. More than an emphasis on "form" or "computation,"
formal analysis requires the development of theoretical commitments, vulnerable, at the outset,
to empirical verification (being wrong). Many questions in the social sciences and the
humanities can benefit from formal analysis grounded in the particularities of language. The
attention to low-order single-document textual building blocks ("formal features")---word,
sentence, paragraph, story---will sharpen our intuitions about higher-order phenomena, such as
agency, power, authority, style, race, gender, or influence. *How* complex cultural dynamics
can be broken down into components, and then reassembled into models yielding scholarly
insight---that's the topic of this class. Comparison between documents, over time, and across
many texts will comprise Part II of the course.

Though all of the methods introduced can be done by pen and paper, the course will serve as a
gentle introduction to Python programming, using industry-standard tools for text processing.
No prior experience required to participate.

## Course Requirements & Grading

Students will be expected to read the approximate equivalent of three scholarly articles per
week, to attend the seminar weekly, to participate in the class discussion both in person and
online, and to develop a research project that will culminate in a paper. Advanced students
will have the option to integrate the course's themes with the subject matter of their
expertise.

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors, and to
the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the
risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or
ask me for help early in the writing process. We will discuss the use appropriate of AI aids,
such as ChatGPT and Copilot, in class.
